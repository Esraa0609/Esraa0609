## Hi there 👋


 **✨ 📊 Data Dreamer | 💻 Creative Coder | 🎨 Anime-Loving, ⚽Sporty Soul with a Sketchpad**
I don’t just analyze data — I uncover stories behind the numbers. With a mind wired for logic 🧠 and a heart beating for creativity ❤️, 
I live at the crossroads of art and science  🧬🎨.

Fresh out of a Data Science degree 🎓 with top honors 🏅, I’m diving into the world where code meets curiosity 🔍. One minute, 
I’m building machine learning models 🤖 — the next, I’m dubbing anime characters 🎙️ or painting scenes straight from my imagination 🖌️.

Some days I crave quiet 🤫 and a good adventure novel 📚. Other days, I’m all about noise 🔊, cheers 🎉,
and the electric pulse of Anfield 🔴 — dreaming of one day standing shoulder to shoulder with the Liverpool faithful 🙌,
singing for the team that inspires me 🎶⚽🔥.

I don’t just code like a data scientist.
**I create like an artist with a love for numbers.** 🎨📈
💡"Being different isn’t my flaw. It’s my edge."
