## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


 **âœ¨ ðŸ“Š Data Dreamer | ðŸ’» Creative Coder | ðŸŽ¨ Anime-Loving, âš½Sporty Soul with a Sketchpad**

I donâ€™t just analyze data â€” I uncover stories behind the numbers. With a mind wired for logic and a heart beating for creativity, 
I live at the crossroads of art and science.

Armed with a Data Science degree (with top honors) and a passion for bringing both structure and soul into technology, 

I thrive in the world:

###**As a Data Scientist**

I dive deep into oceans of raw data, seeking the patterns that others miss.
I clean, explore, and visualize data, build and train predictive models, and translate numbers into powerful, actionable insights.
Whether it's forecasting trends, segmenting users, or solving real-world problems 
â€” I use data to tell stories that spark decisions.

**But I'm More Than Just Code...**

Fresh out of my degree and fully diving into the world where code meets curiosity â€”  
One minute, 
Iâ€™m building machine learning models â€” the next, 
Iâ€™m dubbing anime characters or painting scenes straight from my imagination.

Some days I crave quiet and a good adventure novel. Other days, Iâ€™m all about noise, cheers,
and the electric pulse of Anfield â€” dreaming of one day standing shoulder to shoulder with the Liverpool faithful,
singing for the team that inspires me.

I donâ€™t just code like a data scientist.

**I create like an artist with a love for numbers.**

ðŸ’¡"Being different isnâ€™t my flaw. Itâ€™s my edge."
