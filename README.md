# Hi there 👋

### ✨ 📊 *Data Dreamer* | 💻 *Creative Coder* | 🎨 *Anime-Loving, ⚽ Sporty Soul with a Sketchpad*

I don’t just analyze data — **I uncover the stories hidden in the noise**.  
With a mind wired for logic and a heart rooted in creativity, I thrive where **art meets science**.

---

### 🎓 **Armed with a Data Science degree (with top honors)**  
I bring both structure and soul into every line of code, every graph, and every model I build.

---

### 🚀 **As a Data Scientist**

I dive deep into oceans of raw data, surfacing insights that move minds and decisions.  
From cleaning and exploring messy datasets, to building predictive models and visualizing patterns —  
**I speak the language of numbers, fluently and fearlessly.**

Whether it’s:
- 📈 Forecasting future trends  
- 👥 Segmenting users with smart clustering  
- 🧠 Solving real-world challenges with machine learning  

I transform complex data into compelling narratives that spark action.

### 🎭 **But I’m More Than Just Code...**

Fresh from the academic trenches, I’m boldly stepping into the arena where **curiosity meets creation**.

One moment, I'm tuning hyperparameters.  
The next, I'm sketching anime scenes, voice-acting characters, or getting lost in an epic novel.  
Some days I find peace in solitude — others, I’m shouting my lungs out with the **Anfield faithful**, dreaming of standing in that sea of red, singing for the team that stirs my soul: **Liverpool FC**.

---

### 🧠💖 I don’t just think like a scientist.  
**I feel like an artist.**  
And I create like both.

> 💡 *"Being different isn’t my flaw. It’s my edge."*
