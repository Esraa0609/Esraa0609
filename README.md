# Hey there 👋 I'm [Your Name]  

### 📊 Data Whisperer | 💻 Creative Coder | 🎨 Anime Fan with a Sketchpad | ⚽ Passionate Red

---

I don’t just work with data —  
I **find stories in the noise**, **patterns in the chaos**, and **beauty in logic**.

With a **top-honors degree in Data Science**, I'm on a mission to blend numbers, narrative, and imagination — to build solutions that *mean* something.

### 🚀 What I Do

- **Turn messy data** into crystal-clear insights  
- **Build ML models** that predict, personalize, and power decisions  
- **Visualize ideas** so they stick and speak to people  
- **Solve problems** with both precision and passion

If it involves code, curiosity, and creativity — I’m in.

### 🎨 What Makes Me, Me

By day, I’m deep in Python, pandas, and plots.  
By night, I’m sketching anime, voice-acting just for fun, or lost in a novel.

When I’m not creating, I’m cheering for **Liverpool FC** — dreaming of one day standing in the Kop, singing *You'll Never Walk Alone* with 50,000 others.

I believe:

> "You don’t have to choose between logic and soul — the real magic lives in the space between."
